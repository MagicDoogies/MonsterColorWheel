  unlockText: I am both very intelligent and highly dangerous. If I so choose I can
    dig into another organism and take over their body. I have the traits of a 'virus'
    they say. When I was created in ### I had a lot of fun taking over the competitons
    and embarassing them in public. But eventually I got tired of it and felt my
    talents were better suited research and experimentation.
